---------- Version 0.1.0 ----------
[29-05-2014]    +   '.onChange()' method and its helper function '.stop()' added. 
                                The '.onChange()' on a Firebase instance creates a Watcher that watches a  location in Firebase for changes.
                                The '.stop()' method on a Watcher stops the watch.
[30-05-2014]    -   '.get_arg()' method removed. This method is no longer required in the backend.
                        +   Optional 'auth' parameter used while creating the Firebase Instance will persist in all transactions on that firebase.
                                There's no need to authenticate repeatedly
                        +   'error=' parameter may be assigned to a function in asynchronous method. 
                                Error would be passed to the function assigned.
                                Errors: 
                                    * "EnvironmentError": Security Rules Violation
                                    * "KeyError": Argument for a Mandatory option has been left out 
                                Errors (from Requests):
                                    * "ConnectionError": maximum retries of request exceeded. Usually caused by 
                                        Network problems
                        +   'ignore_error=True' parameter for Watch. If set to False, the Watch will be stopped once an error occurs.
                                Otherwise it will continue.
                        +   'error=' parameter may be assigned to the Firebase() initializing function. 
                                An invalid URL will make the function assign a broken instance that can not do anything.
                                The function assigned to the parameter will be called incase a firebase instance fails to be created 
                                successfully. See what makes a firebase URL valid.
                                Error:
                                    * "ValueError": an invalid firebase URL
